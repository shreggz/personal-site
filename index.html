            <p>I am a flute player living in Indianapolis. My repertoire is eclectic, but I am primarily interested in 17th and 18th century music. In 2021 I recorded my first album, <a href="https://sridharbhagavathula.bandcamp.com/album/the-quarantine-tapes" target="_blank">The Quarantine Tapes</a>, which consisted of works by JS Bach, GP Telemann, and WB Laybourn. That project was my first real attempt to exploit the creative possibilities of the microphone, and I fell in love with the process. I will write about music and media one day, but for now, let me point you to Glenn Gould's essay on <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/AudioMedia/Readings/Alphabetical/Gould-Prospects_of_Recording.pdf" target="_blank">The Prospects of Recording</a>, which has been a major influence on my thinking.</p>
            <p>I chat about music and its attendant matters with my friend Chris Arkin on the <a href="https://www.impolitetolisten.com/" target="_blank">Impolite to Listen</a> podcast. The show is available on all good podcast players. Imagine we are seated next to you at the bar--it may be impolite to listen in, but come on, you know you want to.</p>
            <p><a href="https://thepedestrian.substack.com/" target="_blank">The Pedestrian</a> is a journal of my insomniac musings on art and society. I have written about <a href="https://thepedestrian.substack.com/p/can-public-transit-revitalize-a-city" target="_blank">urbanism</a>, <a href="https://thepedestrian.substack.com/p/why-bookstores-still-matter" target="_blank">bookstores</a>, <a href="https://thepedestrian.substack.com/p/6-ways-to-avoid-being-a-screen-junkie" target="_blank">screen junkies</a>, <a href="https://thepedestrian.substack.com/p/late-night-thoughts-on-chasing-nabokov" target="_blank">Nabokov's anxiety of influence</a>, and so on. The only common thread running through my topics is that I am intrigued by them--if this sounds interesting to you, consider signing up for my <a href="https://thepedestrian.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>.</p>
            <p>I have also written for <a href="https://areomagazine.com/author/sridharbhagavathula/" target="_blank">Areo</a>, a feisty little humanist magazine. In my spare time I construct crossword puzzles--here is one I made for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2021/03/05" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>.</p>
            <p>The best way to keep up with my music is to follow me on <a href="https://sridharbhagavathula.bandcamp.com/follow_me" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>. I am @shreggz on <a href="https://twitter.com/Shreggz" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/shreggz" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. My email is <a href="mailto:sridhar.bhagavathula@gmail.com">sridhar.bhagavathula@gmail.com</a>. Beware, I can be rather slow to respond.</p>
